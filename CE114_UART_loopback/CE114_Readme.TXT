1. Code Example Description:
----------------------------

In this code examples, UART receives and buffers characters from the hyperterminal at 9600 baudrate.
Once 8 characters are received, UART transmits (echoes) them back to hyperterminal.


void cfgUart2(void)
This function configures UART with following settings viz., 8-data bits, 1-stop 
bit and no parity. 

void cfgDma0UartTx(void)
This function configures DMA channel 0 for UART transmission. DMA configuration:
	Transfer data from RAM to UART
	One-Shot mode
	Register Indirect with Post-Increment
	Using single buffer
	8 transfers per buffer
	Transfer words

void cfgDma1UartRx(void)
This function configures DMA channel 1 for UART reception. DMA configuration: 
	Transfer data from UART to RAM Continuously
	Register Indirect with Post-Increment
	Using two ‘ping-pong’ buffers
	8 transfers per buffer
	Transfer words


void __attribute__((__interrupt__)) _DMA0Interrupt(void)
This interrupt routine handles the transmit.

void __attribute__((__interrupt__)) _DMA1Interrupt(void)
This interrupt routine handles the receive.

2. Folder Contents:
-------------------
This folder contains the following sub-folders:
a. C:\Program Files\Microchip\MPLAB C30\support\gld
        This folder will have the device GLD file, it is used for building the project. 
	This file was provided with the MPLAB® C30 toolsuite.

b. C:\Program Files\Microchip\MPLAB C30\support\h
        This folder contains C header files useful in building this
        project. Device register and bit definitions are provided in
        the *.h file that follows the device name. These files were provided
        with the MPLAB® C30 toolsuite.

c. C:\Program Files\Microchip\MPLAB C30\lib
        This folder contains library archive files, which are a
        collection of precompiled object files. The file
        named "libpic30-coff.a" contains the C run-time start-up
        library. These file were provided with the
        MPLAB® C30 toolsuite.

d. hex
        This folder contains three file types - coff, hex and map.
        These are files generated by the MPLAB® C30 toolsuite on build
        operation performed within MPLAB® IDE. The *.map file contains
        details on memory allocation for various variables, constants
        and dsPIC instructions specified in the source and library
        code. The *.hex file contains a binary file that may be
        programmed into the dsPIC device. The *.coff file contains
        a binary file that is used by MPLAB® IDE for simulation.

e. h
        This folder contains include files for the code example.


f. src
        This folder contains all the C and Assembler source files (*.c,
        *.s) used in demonstrating the described example. This folder
        also contains a sub-folder named "obj" that stores compiled
        object files generated when the project is built.


3. Suggested Development Resources:
-----------------------------------

        a. Explorer 16 Demo board with dsPIC33FJ256GP710 controller

4. Reconfiguring the project for a different dsPIC33F device:
-------------------------------------------------------------
The Project/Workspace can be easily reconfigured for any dsPIC33F device.
Please use the following general guidelines:
        a. Change device selection within MPLAB® IDE to a dsPIC33F device of
        your choice by using the following menu option:
        MPLAB IDE>>Configure>>Select Device

        b. Provide the correct device linker script and header file for your
        device. Device linker scripts and header files are available in your
        MPLAB® C30 installation folder under:
        Device Linker Script-
                YourDrive:>Program Files\Microchip\MPLAB C30\support\gld
        Device C Header file-
                YourDrive:>Program Files\Microchip\MPLAB C30\support\h
        Device ASM Include file-
                YourDrive:>Program Files\Microchip\MPLAB C30\support\inc

        c. Provide the appropriate path to your MPLAB C30 support file locations
        using the menu option:
        MPLAB IDE>>Project>>Build Options>>Project

        d. Chose the development board applicable to your device. Some options
        are provided below:


        e. Re-build the MPLAB® project using the menu option:
        MPLAB IDE>>Project>>Build All

        f. Download the hex file into the device and run.

5. Revision History :
---------------------
        04/01/2006 - Initial Release of the Code Example
	10/02/2006 - HW loopback is replaced with SW loopback, such that application 
                     receives and buffers 8 characters (from hypterterminal);
                     once 8 characters are received, they are echoed back to hyperterminal
        10/02/2006 - lock configuration bits are changed in the project (see configuration bits window)
        10/02/2006 - DMA initialization is changed
        10/02/2006 - UART initialization is changed to work on Explorer 16 board
